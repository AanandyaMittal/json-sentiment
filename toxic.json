{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Toxic par Britney Spears\r\nBaby, can't you see\nI'm calling\nA guy like you\nShould wear a warning\nIt's dangerous\nI'm fallin'\n\nThere's no escape\nI can't wait\nI need a hit\nBaby, give me it\nYou're dangerous\nI'm lovin' it\n\nToo high\nCan't come down\n\nLosing my head\nSpinning 'round and 'round\nDo you feel me now\n\nWith a taste of your lips\nI'm on a ride\nYou're toxic\nI'm slipping under\nWith a taste of poison paradise\nI'm addicted to you\nDon't you know that you're toxic\nAnd I love what you do\nDon't you know that you're toxic\n\nIt's getting late\nTo give you up\nI took a sip\nFrom my devil cup\n\nSlowly\nIt's taking over me\n\nToo high\nCan't come down\nIt's in the air\nAnd it's all around\nCan you feel me now\n\nWith a taste of your lips\nI'm on a ride\nYou're toxic\nI'm slipping under\nWith a taste of poison paradise\nI'm addicted to you\nDon't you know that you're toxic\nAnd I love what you do\nDon't you know that you're toxic\n\n\nDon't you know that you're toxic\n\nWith a tast of your lips\nI'm on a ride\nYou're toxic\nI'm slipping under\nWith a taste of poison paradise\nI'm addicted to you\nDon't you know that you're toxic\n\nIntoxicate me now\nWith your lovin' now\nI think I'm ready now\nI think I'm ready now\nIntoxicate me now\nWith your lovin' now\nI'm ready now"}
