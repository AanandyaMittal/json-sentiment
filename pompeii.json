{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Pompeii par Bastille\r\nI was left to my own devices\nMany days fell away with nothing to show\n\nAnd the walls kept tumbling down\nIn the city that we love\nGreat clouds roll over the hills\nBringing darkness from above\n\nBut if you close your eyes,\nDoes it almost feel like\nNothing changed at all?\nAnd if you close your eyes,\nDoes it almost feel like\nYou've been here before?\nHow am I gonna be an optimist about this?\nHow am I gonna be an optimist about this?\n\n\nWe were caught up and lost in all of our vices\nIn your pose as the dust settles around us\n\nAnd the walls kept tumbling down\nIn the city that we love\nGreat clouds roll over the hills\nBringing darkness from above\n\nBut if you close your eyes,\nDoes it almost feel like\nNothing changed at all?\nAnd if you close your eyes,\nDoes it almost feel like\nYou've been here before?\nHow am I gonna be an optimist about this?\nHow am I gonna be an optimist about this?\n\n\nOh where do we begin?\nThe rubble or our sins?\nOh where do we begin?\nThe rubble or our sins?\n\nAnd the walls kept tumbling down\nIn the city that we love\nGreat clouds roll over the hills\nBringing darkness from above\n\nBut if you close your eyes,\nDoes it almost feel like\nNothing changed at all?\nAnd if you close your eyes,\nDoes it almost feel like\nYou've been here before?\nHow am I gonna be an optimist about this?\nHow am I gonna be an optimist about this?"}
