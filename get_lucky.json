{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Get Lucky par Daft Punk\r\nLike the legend of the phoenix\nAll ends with beginnings\nWhat keeps the planet spinning\nThe force from the beginning\n\nWe've come too far to give up who we are\nSo let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars\n\nShe's up all night 'til the sun\nI'm up all? night to get some\nShe's up all night for good fun\nI'm up all night to get lucky\nWe're up all night 'til the sun\nWe're up all? night to get some\nWe're up all night for good fun\nWe're up all night to get lucky\n\n\n\nWe're up all night to get lucky (x4)\n\nThe present has no living\nYour gift keeps on giving\nWhat is this I'm feeling?\nIf you wanna leave I'm ready (ahh)\n\nWe've come too far to give up who we are\nSo let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars\n\nShe's up all night 'til the sun\nI'm up all? night to get some\nShe's up all night for good fun\nI'm up all night to get lucky\nWe're up all night 'til the sun\nWe're up all? night to get some\n\nWe're up all night for good fun\nWe're up all night to get lucky\n\nWe're up all night to get lucky (x4)\n\nWe're up all night to get lucky (x10)\n\nWe've come too far to give up who we are\nSo let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars\n\nShe's up all night 'til the sun\nI'm up all? night to get some\nShe's up all night for good fun\nI'm up all night to get lucky\nWe're up all night 'til the sun\nWe're up all? night to get some\nWe're up all night for good fun\nWe're up all night to get lucky\n\n\nWe're up all night to get lucky (x8)"}
